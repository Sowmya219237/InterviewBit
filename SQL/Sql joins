1)You are given a table having the marks of one student in every test (Tests are held every day). You have to output the tests in which the student has improved his performance. For a student to improve his performance he has to score more than the previous test. Given that TestIDs are in increasing order, forming a continuous sequence without any missing numbers.
select t2.TestId from Tests t1,Tests t2 where t1.TestId=t2.TestId-1 and t1.marks<t2.marks; 

2)Given 2 tables ‘Students’ and ‘Departments’. Write an SQL query to find the students who has the Lowest GPA in each of the departments. 
select concat(d.DepartmentName,',',s.Name,',',s.GPA) as A from Students s left join Departments d on s.DepartmentId=d.DepartmentId where s.GPA=
(select min(s2.GPA) from Students s2 where s2.DepartmentId=d.DepartmentId )group by d.DepartmentName;

3)Given 2 tables ‘Students’ and ‘Jobs’, write an SQL query to find for every student the number of offers they got in the month of November. The output should contain 1 coloumn by the name ‘Job_Offers’ which should contain the number of jobs received by each of the student in the month of November. Also it should be sorted by the Id of the students.
select count(j.Id) as Job_Offers  from Students s left join Jobs j on s.Id=j.Id 
and month(j.Date)='11' group by s.Id order by s.Id;

4)Write a SQL Query to find the name of all reviewers who have rated their ratings with a NULL value.
select r.reviewer_name from reviewers r inner join ratings rt on r.reviewer_id=rt.reviewer_id where rt.reviewer_stars
IS NULL;

5)Write a SQL Query to find the movie_title and name of director (first and last names combined) who directed a movie that casted a role as ‘SeanMaguire’.
select  CONCAT(d.director_first_name, d.director_last_name) director_name,m.movie_title from movies_cast mc inner join  movies m on mc.movie_id = m.movie_id 
 inner join movies_directors md  on m.movie_id=md.movie_id inner join directors d 
 on d.director_id=md.director_id where mc.role="SeanMaguire";

6)Write a SQL Query to find those lowest duration movies along with the year, director’s name(first and last name combined), actor’s name(first and last name combined) and his/her role in that production.
select m.movie_title as movie_title,m.movie_year as movie_year,CONCAT(d.director_first_name,d.director_last_name) as director_name,concat(a.actor_first_name,a.actor_last_name) as actor_name,mc.role as role from movies m 
inner join movies_cast mc on m.movie_id=mc.movie_id
inner join actors a on mc.actor_id=a.actor_id
inner join movies_directors md on m.movie_id=md.movie_id
inner join directors d on md.director_id=d.director_id
where m.movie_time=(select min(movie_time) from movies);
